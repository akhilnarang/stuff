### Tests for Carbohydrates, Fats/Oils, and Proteins.

### Requirements:
##### Carbohydrates:
Molisch's reagent, Fehling's solution, Tollen's reagent, Benedict's solution, carbohydrates, starch,
glucose, sucrose(cane-sugar), lactose(milk-sugar).
##### Fats/Oils:
Chloroform, ethyl alcohol, KHSO<sub>4</sub> crystals, furfural solution, Huble's solution, desi ghee, vegetable ghee, and refined oil.
##### Proteins:
Egg albumin dispersion, gelatin dispersion, Millon's reagent, and Ninhydrin reagent.

|Experiement|Observation|Inference|
|-----------|-----------|---------|
|Concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> test. Given carbohydrate in test<br/>tube, add concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, heat.|Charring occurs with<br/>smell of burnt sugar.|Carbohydrate is present.|
|Molisch's reagenttest. 1 ml aqueous solution of<br/>carbohydrate + 3 drops of Molisch's reagent +<br/> concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> along the sides of the test tube.|A purple ring at the<br/>junction of two <br/>layers is observed.|Carbohydrate is present.|
|Fehling's solution test. Take 1 ml Fehling A + 1 ml<br/>Fehling B in a test tube, add carbohydrate solution,<br/>and heat.|Red precipitate is<br/>observed.|Carbohydrate is present.|
|Tollen's reagent test. Keep an aqueous solution of <br/> carbohydrate + Tollen's reagent in a boiling water <br/> bath for a minute.|Formation of a gray <br/>precipitate or a silver<br/>mirror is observed.|Carbohydrate is present.|
|Benedict's test. Keep an aqueous solution of <br/>carbohydrate + Benedict's reagent in a boiling <br/> water bath.|Red precipitate is obtained.|Carbohydrate is present.|
|End Carbohydrates.||Start Oils/Fats.|
|Solubility test. Add a drop of given oil or fat in a)water,<br/> b)alcohol, and <br/>c)chloroform.|a)Dosen't dissolve,<br/>b)Sample forms lower layer, and <br/>c)Miscible.|Oil/Fat is present.|
|Spot test. Put a drop of oil/fat on paper.|Appearance of translucent spot.|Oil/Fat is present.|
|Acrolein test. Take the sample of Oil/Fat, add <br/>KHSO<sub>4</sub>, heat.|Smell of acrolein<br/>(irratating odour)|Oil/Fat is present.|
|End Oils/Fats.||Start Proteins.|
|Biuret test. Heat 1 ml of protein solution in water +<br/>5 drops NaOH+CuSO<sub>4</sub> solution dropwise.|Appearance of violet color <br/>complex with Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions.|Protein is present.|
|Xanthoproteic test. Heat 1 ml of protein solution + <br/>few dops of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub>.|Yellow precipitate is observed.|Protein is present.|
|Ninhydrin test. Boil 1 ml of protein solution + few <br/> drops of 0.1% ninhydrin solution.|Appearance of blue color on <br/>cooling.|Protein is present.|
|Millon's test. To 1 ml of protein solution add 1 ml<br/> of Millon's reagent.|White precipitate is observed<br/>which turns red on heating in <br/> a water bath.|Protein is present.|
