Chapter 1
Laws Of Chemical Combination:-

-Law Of Conservation Of Mass
It states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed.
<Antoine Lavoisier (1789)>

-Law Of Definite Proportions aka Law Of Definite Composition
It states that a given compound always contains exactly the same proprotion of elements by weight.
<Joseph Proust>
He took 2 samples of CuCO3, synthetic and natural.
Both had exactly the same amounts of Cu, O, and C.

-Law Of Multiple Proportions
If two elements can combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element, are in a whole number ratio.
<Dalton (1803)>
Example
Hydrogen (2g) + Oxygen (16g) ---> Water (18g)
Hydrogen (2g) + Oxygen (32g) ---> Hydrogen Peroxide (34g)

Mass of Hydrogen remains constant, and Oxygen is in whole number ratio 1:2.

-Gay Lussac's Law Of Combining Volumes
When gases combine they do so in volumes that bear a simple whole number ratio to one another and to the products, if gaseous, provided that the temperature and pressure of the reacting gases remains constant.
<Gay Lussac (1808)>

-Avogadro's Law
Equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules under the same conditions of temperature and pressure.
<Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro di Quarega edi Carreto (1811)>

He made a distinction between molecules and atoms that is quite undestandable in the modern times.
If we see the reaction of Hydrogen and Oxygen to give water, 2 volumes of Hydrogen react with 1 volume of Oxygen to give 2 volumes of water, leaving no unreacted Oxygen.
He explained this by considering the molecules to be polyatomic, as known now (diatomic). However, at that time, noone believed that atoms of the same kind could combine to form a molecule.
