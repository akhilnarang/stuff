Redox Reactions

Oxidation Number Method

1. The total increase in oxidation number should be equal to the total decrease in oxidation number.
2. Mass balance - There should be same number of atoms of each kind in reactant and products.
3. Charge Balance - Sum of actual charges on both sides of the equation must equal each other
4. Acidic Medium - For one excess oxygen atom add a water molecule on the other side and 2 H+ on the side of excess O2.
5. Alkaline Medium - For one excess oxygen atom add 1 water molecule on the same side and OH- on the other.
   In case Hydrogen are still unbalanced, for each extra Hydrogen atom add one OH- on that side, 1 water on the other side.


Half Reaction Method

1. Write down the oxidation and reduction reactions separately and completely balance them.
2. The number of electrons gained or lost in each half reaction must be equalized.
3. Finally the half reactions are added to get the overall balanced equation.
4. The number of oxygen atoms is balanced as mentioned earlier.


Oxidation Number

It denotes the oxidation state of an element in a compound ascertained according to a set of rules formulated on the basis that
electron pair in a covalent bond belongs entirely to the more electronegative element.

Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance.

Reduction: A decrease in the oxidation number of the element in the given substance.

Oxidizing agent:  A reagent which can increase the oxidation number of an element in a given substance.
                  These reagents are also called oxidants.

Reducing agents: A reagent which lowers the oxidation number of an element in a given substance.
                 These reagents are also called reductants.

Redox reactions: Reactions which involve change in oxidation number of the interacting species.
